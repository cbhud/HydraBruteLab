# HydraBruteLab - University Security Project

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
**FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.** This project and its associated scripts are designed strictly for a controlled, local environment (localhost) for university coursework. I do not take responsibility for any misuse or damage caused by this script outside of this specific lab environment.

## 🛠 Project Overview
This lab demonstrates the practical application of **Brute Force attacks** using `Hydra` and the defensive mechanisms used to stop them. It compares a vulnerable "Simple" website against an "Advanced" website protected by password complexity and account lockout policies.

### Requirements
* **OS:** Kali Linux
* **Services:** XAMPP (Apache & MySQL)
* **Tools:** `Hydra`, `curl`

### 1. Prepare the Script
Make sure the bash script is executable:
```bash
sudo /opt/lampp/lampp start
```

---

### 3. Run the Demonstration
Execute the script and choose the target environment (1 for Simple, 2 for Advanced):
```bash
sudo ./run.sh
```
